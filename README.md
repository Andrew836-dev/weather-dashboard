## What is it?
This is a web app that uses the ajax calls in jQuery to get weather info from openweathermap.org. There is a checkbox to toggle between metric and imperial units, which also changes the date formatting. After a city has been successfully found it is added to the app's search history with a country code. Any city name in the history list can be clicked on to get that weather again and the most recently viewed city appears at the top of the list. The last 5 searched cities are saved to localStorage and the most recently viewed will be automatically searched on page load.

### Technical details
